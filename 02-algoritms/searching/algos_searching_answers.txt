1.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
Answer: 7 iterations

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
Answer: 3 iterations

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

fib(10) = fib(9) + fib(8) => 34 + 21 => Answer: 55

fib(11) => fib(10) + fib(9) => 55 + 34 => Answer: 89

fib(12) => fib(11) + fib(10) => 89 + 55 => Answer: 144
